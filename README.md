## Abstract

In this thesis, I develop _The Epistemic Architecture of Power_, a unified theoretical framework for explaining how authority in political, corporate, and institutional contexts is sustained through control of epistemic agency. Drawing on classical political theory, political epistemology, and my own _Epistemic Clientelism Theory_ (ECT), I examine three primary modalities through which epistemic capture occurs: representation, alliance, and appeasement.

I show how representation, typically conceived as a channel of empowerment, can evolve into epistemic oligarchy when representatives monopolise both decision-making and interpretation. I analyse how alliances, while enabling cooperation, risk epistemic lock-in when members suppress dissent to preserve unity. I demonstrate how appeasement, in which less powerful actors pre-emptively adopt dominant interpretive frames, fosters reflexive deference and eliminates internal challenge. Across modalities, I trace four recurring mechanisms — delegated interpretation, narrative consolidation, information gatekeeping, and epistemic socialisation — that systematically narrow interpretive horizons, reduce contestability, and entrench dependency.

I advance a normative critique of these dynamics, arguing that epistemic agency is a public good and that holders of interpretive authority bear fiduciary-epistemic duties to protect it. I propose modality-specific reforms and cross-cutting systemic interventions to counter epistemic monopolisation, embed interpretive pluralism, and protect dissent. My framework functions as both a descriptive model for diagnosing epistemic capture and a prescriptive tool for governance reform.

By reframing the politics of authority as the politics of knowing, I demonstrate that epistemic justice is inseparable from political justice, and that democratising epistemic power is essential for legitimate, adaptive, and accountable governance.
